NOTE: WeaponOut.json has been moved into the (Mod Configs/) folder.

* Temporary spawn point tents! Silk + Wood.
* Whips! Deals crits when hitting at the tip.

* Dual-use Weapons! Right-click for secondary weapon abilities.
* More shields! Obtainable early, with situational uses.

WeaponOut Lite
	WeaponOut is a quality of life and content mods that introduces items that use interesting game mechanics balanced for vanilla Terraria, but are capable of holding up to modded playthroughs. It adds fist, whips, multi-function and team support items as well as ease-of-use functions such as toggleable autoswing, teleporting hooks and temporary spawn points.
	
	WeaponOut Lite is based on the original function of WeaponOut, that is, showing your currently equipped weapon on your person when not attacking. This version of the mod is just for that vanity effect without any content provided in the main mod.
